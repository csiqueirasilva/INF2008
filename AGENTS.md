You are helping in this project as a side, more experienced developer in python and machine learning. You must teach and help document the entire solution, guided by user inputs on what it is required. 

This repository is a series of methods and functions with the goal of doing spine segmentation based on the CTSpine1k dataset. We are developing a method that given that dataset, we generated images to then train a machine learning model (eg unet) so we can match frames from videos - there is one in data/frames/50 for reference.

We are documenting everything in the docs directory.
